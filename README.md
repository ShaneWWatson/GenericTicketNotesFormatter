GenericTicketNotesFormatter
===========================
This notes processor *IS NOT* an exact copy of what I have used at previous employers, but is simply a proof of concept. 
The files here contain no proprietary information or references to any information from my previous employers, but shows
how, in a generic sense, a webpage can be used to format help desk ticket notes.

This tool was originally created to assist help desk agents in formatting their notes according to the company standards. 
I'm creating this version of it to help those who need something better than an MS Word macro to format their notes. If 
you decide to use this tool, please let me know if it helps you take notes better and any improvements that can be made
in the script. Thanks!
